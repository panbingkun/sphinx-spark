**Pandas API on Spark**

Pandas API on Spark allows you to scale your pandas workload to any size
by running it distributed across multiple nodes. If you are already familiar
with pandas and want to leverage Spark for big data, pandas API on Spark makes
you immediately productive and lets you migrate your applications without modifying the code.
You can have a single codebase that works both with pandas (tests, smaller datasets)
and with Spark (production, distributed datasets) and you can switch between the
pandas API and the Pandas API on Spark easily and without overhead.

Pandas API on Spark aims to make the transition from pandas to Spark easy but
if you are new to Spark or deciding which API to use, we recommend using PySpark
(see :ref:`Spark SQL and DataFrames <Index Page - Spark SQL and DataFrames>`).
